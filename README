USAGE
=====

u2b [ -f <format> ] [words] | -h

Search YouTube for words, print title, stream URL and thumbnail link of hits.
The stream URL is directly playable by the Raspberry Pi's omxplayer.
When words are omitted, a list of featured videos is printed.

-h          Print this help text and exit
-f <format> Supported formats are ini (default) and html

In html format, each video has a stream link called its title, followed
by a thumbnail image.

HOW TO SEARCH YOUTUBE
=====================

https://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos?q=Dancing%20Galaxy

This URL returns an XML containing hits for the term "Dancing Galaxy"
which is searched for the title, the stream-URL and a small thumbnail.

WHY CURL?
=========

u2b is extremely minimalistic to make it fast on the Raspberry Pi.
The mere mention of `use LWP::Simple;` causes several seconds of compilation
overhead at the beginning.

curl also supports proxies, if the http_proxy environment variable is defined.
