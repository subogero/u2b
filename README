HOW TO SEARCH YOUTUBE
=====================

https://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos?q=Dancing%20Galaxy

This URL returns an XML containing hits for the term "Dancing Galaxy"
which is searched for the title, the URL and a small thumbnail.

EXTRACTING STREAM URL FOR OMXPLAYER
===================================

The command

youtube-dl -g URL

is used for this purpose. See https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl

WHY CURL?
=========

u2b is extremely minimalistic to make it fast on the Raspberry Pi.
The mere mention of `use LWP::Simple;` causes several seconds of compilation
overhead at the beginning.

curl also supports proxies, if the http_proxy environment variable is defined.
