WWW::U2B
========

A Perl library used by u2b to search videos and extract stream data for them.

WHY CURL?
=========

u2b is extremely minimalistic to make it fast on the Raspberry Pi.
The mere mention of `use LWP::Simple;` causes several seconds of compilation
overhead at the beginning.

curl also supports proxies, if the http_proxy environment variable is defined.
